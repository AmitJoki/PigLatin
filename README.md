PigLatin

A simple translator that changes standard english to Pig Latin

This was made out of interest while answering a question on StackOverflow!

Its just a simple method, that converts the standard English to Pig Latin.

Its MIT licensed, so do what you like with this.

Though it is written in C#, it can be easily portable to any language.
