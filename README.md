PigLatin
========

A simple translator that changes standard english to Pig Latin

This was made out of interest while answering a question on StackOverflow!

Its just a simple method, that converts the standard English to Pig Latin.

#How to use it?

After including it, its as simple as this:

```
string s = "I like Pig Latin!";
Console.WriteLine(PigLatin.PigLatinTranslator(s)); // call the static method directly
Console.WriteLine(s.ToPigLatin()); // or use an extension method
```

Its MIT licensed, so do what you like with this.

Though it is written in C#, it can be easily portable to any language.
